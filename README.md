The project uses kaggle datasets from the March Machine Learning Mania 2025 to build features from which a logistic regression model
can predict outcomes of tournament games. The features are comprised of regular season data, to reflect how a person would predict before 
making their own tournament bracket. The initial features chosen are Win Percentage Difference, Points Per Game Difference, Points Allowed
Per Game Difference, and Seed Difference, with more to be added. These features were chosen from the regular season compact dataset, and additional
features will be chosen from the regular season detailed dataset, for greater information gain. The current ROC AUC accuracy with a logistic regression model
is 75%, with hope for possible improvement through a change in model and additional features.
